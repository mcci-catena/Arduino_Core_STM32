# Arduino core support for STM32L082-based boards

This repository is MCCI's version of [Arduino_Core_STM32](https://github.com/stm32duino/Arduino_Core_STM32), adapted for the STM32L082. The BSP here targets the STM32L082 as used in the Murata CMWX1ZZABZ LoRa&reg; module, as further in the MCCI Catena&reg; LoRaWAN&reg; technology boards. Several of these boards are closely compatible with the Adafruit Feather M0 LoRa. See [Supported Boards and CPUs](#supported-boards-and-cpus) for more info.

For general information, please check the stm32duino [README.md](https://github.com/stm32duino/Arduino_Core_STM32#arduino-core-support-for-stm32-based-boards), especially the [Getting Started](https://github.com/stm32duino/Arduino_Core_STM32#getting-started) section.

## Getting Started

This repository is available as a package usable with the [Arduino Boards Manager](https://www.arduino.cc/en/guide/cores).  Add this URL to _"Additional Boards Manager URLs"_ under `File>Preferences`:

`https://github.com/mcci-catena/arduino-boards/raw/master/BoardManagerFiles/package_mcci_index.json`

For full instructions on using the "**Boards Manager**", see  [Installing the MCCI Catena BSP](https://github.com/mcci-catena/arduino-boards#installing-the-mcci-catena-bsp).

## Features

The Arduino IDE allows you to select the following items.

- **LoRaWAN Region**: when using the Arduino LMIC, you can select North America, Europe, Australia, Asia-923, Japan, Korea, or India as your target region.
- **Optimization**: choose smallest, fast, faster, fastest, or debug.
- **Serial interface**: Select "USB Serial", "Generic Serial" or "No Serial".
- **System clock**: Select "32 MHz (most power)", "24 MHz", "16 MHz", "4.194 MHz (no USB)" or "2.097 MHz (no USB, least power)". If "2.097 MHz (no USB, least power)" or "4.194 MHz (no USB)" is selected, then you cannot use "USB Serial" for serial interface.
- **Upload method**: select Mass Storage, DFU, or STLink. DFU works well, but requires use of the boot jumper to select DFU mode, and a little driver wrangling on Windows.

## Troubleshooting

If you have any issue, you may [file an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/mcci-catena/Arduino_Core_STM32/issues/new).  You may also submit a support request on the [MCCI support forum](http://portal.mcci.com).

## Installing a Development Copy of this BSP

If you want to develop and test changes to this package, we suggest the following.

1. Install the current release from the standard location using the Arduino `Tools>Boards>Boards Manager...` menu. This installs tools and so forth.
2. Select a board supported by this package.
3. Create an empty sketch with Arduino `File>New`, and check that you can build.
4. Close the Arduino IDE.
5. Clone this repo to a convenient spot on your computer.
6. Open a command window and go to the Arduino board installation directory. It will be one of the following.

   | System | Location |
   |:------:|:---------|
   | Windows 7 through 10 | <code>c:\Users\\<em><strong>username</strong></em>\AppData\Local\Arduino15</code>. If you're using git bash, you can also use `~/AppData/Local/Arduino15` |
   | macOS | <code>~/Library/Arduino15</code> |
   | Linux | <code>~/.arduino15</code> |

7. From this location, change directory to `packages/mcci/stm32`.
8. Look at the directory contents with `ls`. You'll see a directory named like a version number, for example `1.0.8`.
9. Move the directory you just found away from the `stm32` directory. It's convenient to have it around, so we suggest that you not delete it.
10. Create a symbolic link to the sandbox you created in step (3) above. On macOS and Linux, this is done using the `ln -s` command. On Windows 10, this is done with the `mklink /d` command. (On older versions of Windows, unless you're very experienced, you might want to use a Linux VM in VirtualBox -- we can't advise on the best way to do this.)
11. Open the Arduino IDE.
12. Use the menu `File>New` to create an empty sketch (or reuse the sketch from step 3).
13. Make sure the board you want to develop for is selected in `Tools>Boards`.
14. Make changes and build.

Remember to restart the IDE whenever you change `platform.txt`, `boards.txt` or `programmers.txt`.

## Release History

- HEAD adds system clock calibration and read analog code from Catena-Arduino-Platform module ([#126](https://github.com/mcci-catena/Arduino_Core_STM32/issues/126)).

- [v2.6.0](https://github.com/mcci-catena/Arduino_Core_STM32/releases/tag/v2.6.0) adds support for KR-920 (Korea 920 MHz) in the region selection menu ([#117](https://github.com/mcci-catena/Arduino_Core_STM32/issues/117)). Adds official library.properties fields for linking pre-compiled object and adds additional pins definitions for SX1276 radios ([#128](https://github.com/mcci-catena/Arduino_Core_STM32/issues/128)) (thanks to Kent Williams). Add source-level debugging support ([#122](https://github.com/mcci-catena/Arduino_Core_STM32/issues/122)). Adjust USB `Vbus` check values for Catena 461x platform. Define AU915 as well as AU921 for LMIC migration ([#131](https://github.com/mcci-catena/Arduino_Core_STM32/issues/131)). Fix link "`warning: changing start of section .bss by 4 bytes`" ([#129](https://github.com/mcci-catena/Arduino_Core_STM32/issues/129)). Update issue template.

- [v2.5.0](https://github.com/mcci-catena/Arduino_Core_STM32/releases/tag/v2.5.0) enables the crystal controlled LSE clock, and uses it to run the RTC. Code was substantially refactored to move common code to common directories. Bug fixes.

- [v2.4.0](https://github.com/mcci-catena/Arduino_Core_STM32/releases/tag/v2.4.0) Added support for new boards: 4617, 4618 and 4630. Serial interface configuration in `boards.template` has been updated with new option to use both USB Serial and Hardware Serial at same time.

- [v2.3.0](https://github.com/mcci-catena/Arduino_Core_STM32/releases/tag/v2.3.0) corrects the handling of clocking in the various SLEEP/STOP/SSTANDBY modes. It also ensures that `.RamFunc` code is properly placed in RAM (initialzed when statics are initialized).

- [v2.2.1](https://github.com/mcci-catena/Arduino_Core_STM32/releases/tag/v2.2.1) fixed the version number in `platform.txt`, and sets GPIO to reset state when de-initializing SPI, I2C and UARTs.

- [v2.2.0](https://github.com/mcci-catena/Arduino_Core_STM32/releases/tag/v2.2.0) increases the serial buffer size to 256 and adds low-power changes for the Catena 4801.

- [v2.1.0](https://github.com/mcci-catena/Arduino_Core_STM32/releases/tag/v2.1.0) fixed the device ID register offset, and improved sleep mode power.

- [v2.0.0](https://github.com/mcci-catena/Arduino_Core_STM32/releases/tag/v2.0.0) is a major release. It improves wakeup support and power management, and simplifies some of the menus. New boards: 4610 and 4801. The template system was enhanced. USB manufacturer string is no longer "unknown". Changed hardware serial default baud rate to 115,200 from 9600. Moved USB clock control to USB module. Enhanced begin()/end() for USB and I2C to start/stop clocks. (This is a major bump beause the baud rate change may be a breaking change.)

- [v1.1.2](https://github.com/mcci-catena/Arduino_Core_STM32/releases/tag/v1.1.2) added 4611, 4612 support, and templating for generating boards.txt.
